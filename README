libgomp-lithe - README
For questions or comments, please contact: Kevin Klues <klueska@cs.berkeley.edu>

This includes a lithe "ported" implementation of libgomp ripped out of
gcc-4.4-20081212.

The library built is called libgomp-lithe
To build do the following:

cd src
autoreconf --install
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=<install_dir>
make
make install

Don't forget to use 'sudo' if you are installing into a directory which
requires root priveleges.

Running 'make check' should work for you too
To see the results of it look in:
src/build/testsuite/libgomp.log

Also, if you install to a non-standard <install_dir>, it's probably a good idea
to add these paths to a few environment variables.  Doing this will allow you
to compile and run programs that depend on this library much easier. I set
these variables in my .bashrc file in my home directory, but feel free to set
them however you like.

C_INCLUDE_PATH = <install_dir>/include
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH = <install_dir>/include
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = <install_dir>/lib
LD_RUN_PATH = <install_dir>/lib

Alternatively, you can set up a gcc spec file so that these tools will be
available to all users on the system.  See the following link for details:
