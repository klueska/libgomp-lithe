libgomp-lithe - README
For questions or comments, please contact: Kevin Klues <klueska@cs.berkeley.edu>

This includes a lithe "ported" implementation of libgomp ripped out of
gcc-4.6.1

The library built is called libgomp-lithe

To install this library, simply follow the standard GNU installation procedure.
If you have 'parlib' and 'lithe' installed in a non-standard location, be sure
and set the --with-parlib and --with-lithe configure options appropriately.
Otherwise, you can just ignore them.

cd libgomp
./bootstrap
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=<install_dir> \
             --with-parlib=<parlib_install_dir> \
             --with-lithe=<lithe_install_dir>
make
make install

Don't forget to use 'sudo' if you are installing into a directory which
requires root priveleges.

Running 'make check' should work for the most part.  Not all of libgomp has
been ported, so not all of the tests will pass yet. 
To see the results look in:
src/build/testsuite/libgomp.log

Also, if you install to a non-standard <install_dir>, it's probably a good idea
to add these paths to a few environment variables.  Doing this will allow you
to compile and run programs that depend on this library much easier. I set
these variables in my .bashrc file in my home directory, but feel free to set
them however you like.

C_INCLUDE_PATH = <install_dir>/include
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH = <install_dir>/include
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = <install_dir>/lib
LD_RUN_PATH = <install_dir>/lib

Alternatively, you can set up a gcc spec file so that these tools will be
available to all users on the system.  See the following link for details:
